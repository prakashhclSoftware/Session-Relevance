Now we will start traversing into use cases vs specific query asks... There is a 2 parts to the answer.. 
1. Explain your logic
2. Then show me the query
3. Figure out how you can convey your message through a UI component. 

Example
Q:I am a customers Workstations Depoyment CIO... Our total company has 11K assets, of which 1K are servers and 10K are workstations... I manage the workstation deployment.... I am ulitmately accountable for all workstations security and compliance within my enviornment. 

Q I want to know what are the most vulnerable machines within my enviornment when it comes to fixlets with CVEs... I want the answer to take in account not all workstations are created equal... For example, our board of director machines are in a computer group... And those assets should be prioritizzed.

Q I want to know how I should prioritize mitigating vulnerabilities for my operations team... I want to be able to provide them a list of the top 10 fixlets I want them to mitigate... I want the plan to take in account machines criticality... 

Furthermore... I want you to demonstrate how you could convey your data... I want you to think of your audience. Your speaking to an executive... an executive does not want tables... they want charts \ graphs and pictures...  I want you to look @ https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/ and think through how you could create a component that you feed JSON data from your relevance query to compose a chart to convey your message.
