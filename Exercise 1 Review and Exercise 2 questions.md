#4... in largge enviornments we need to protect agains the property evaluation of something that could potentially not exist

(it, multiplicity of it) of unique values of  operating systems of bes computers 
Becomes
(it, multiplicity of it) of unique values of  operating systems of bes computers whose (exist operating system of it)

#5 unique values of names of bes computers, same here

#6... This is correct ! I have never thought to implement the inspector this way... :)
names of unique values whose (multiplicity of it > 1) of bes computers
	Now show me an alternative way to solve this as well using unique values and a tupple...
	Demonstrate a means to do so while projecting the property assumed...

#7 Tell me what machines within a group are vulnerable for said fixlet (choose a fixlet within the BES support site that is relevant to all your machines)
names of applicable computers whose ( exists names whose (it as string is "My Group") of bes computer group of it ) of bes fixlets whose(name of site of it as string is "BES Support" and id of it = 3172)
	This is incorrect...

Returns ids of relevant fixlets \ applicable comp counts
---
(item 0 of it, item 1 of it) 
OF 
(
(id of it, number of applicable computers of it) of bes fixlets whose (name of site of it = "BES Support")
)
whose
(item 1 of it > 0)
----
Returns (name of it, number of members of it) of bes computer groups
Name of bes computer grp \ num of memebers


#8...
Show me if this is working in your env...

#9 Structurally... this is not correct... There is no filter for the said computer group...


#10 Well Done !

#11 Weel Done !

#12 First example is not working... 2nd is...
	Demonstrate #1 is corking

#13 Well Done !

#14 Demonstrate within lab.. (expected to work)

New Homework :) 
1. Resolve conflicts from excercise #1
2. Show the cross section of machines that are in computer group A and computer group B
3. Show A list of all individual CVEs within the enviornment 
	Ex
	CVE 1
	CVE 2
	CVE 3 
	etc...
4. Show a listing of the individual CVEs and how many different fixlets have them associated... 
	ex:
	CVE 1, 2
	CVE 2, 4
	CVE 3, 15
	etc...
6. Show me all Fixlets that have a CVE field that is not valid, and show me there value...
